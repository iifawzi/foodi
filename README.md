# Foodi - Made with love, for food lovers!

![Untitled-2023-12-02-0248](https://github.com/iifawzi/foodi/assets/46695441/80e714ac-26fa-48cf-80a6-b86257ce6c53)

## Requirements ðŸ“º

A Burger (Product) may have several ingredients:

-   150g Beef
-   30g Cheese
-   20g Onion

The system keeps the stock of each of these ingredients stored in the database. You
can use the following levels for seeding the database:

-   20kg Beef
-   5kg Cheese
-   1kg Onion

When a customer makes an order that includes a Burger. The system needs to update the
the stock of each of the ingredients so it reflects the amounts consumed.
Also when any of the ingredients' stock level reaches 50%, the system should send an
email message to alert the merchant that they need to buy more of this ingredient.

In the sections below, I will explain the requirements that have been approached, the architecture, decisions, and thoughts.

## Installation

The system is configured in a way that it can work with MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite. if you're willing to run it manually you can follow the following steps:

1. Install composer dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer update
    ```

2. Create your configuration file `.env`:

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Configure the database connections as you wish
4. Configure the SMTP mailing server for mailing notifications.
5. Run database migrations and seeders
    ```
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```
6. Run the application in your preferred way, either it's `valet`, `serve`, or any other way.
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
7. Start the queue and schedular workers to handle notifications

    ```
    ./vendor/bin/sail php artisan queue:work
    ```

    ```
     ./vendor/bin/sail php artisan schedule:work
    ```

8. Enjoy your order!

### Using Sail

The project also comes with Laravel Sail that runs mysql by default. if you wish you can follow the following steps:

1. Create your configuration file `.env`:
    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2. Configure the SMTP mailing server for mailing notifications.

3. Start the Docker containers:

    ```
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```

4. Run database migrations and seeders:

    ```
    ./vendor/bin/sail php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

5. Start the queue and schedular workers to handle notifications

    ```
    ./vendor/bin/sail php artisan queue:work
    ```

    ```
     ./vendor/bin/sail php artisan schedule:work
    ```

6. Enjoy your order!

## tl;dr

### Create Order Endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/orders
```

Request:

```json
{
    "merchantId": 1,
    "products": [
        {
            "product_id": 1,
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

## Deep-Dive!

The system is built to be dependable, able to handle many orders at once, and be straightforward to test while maintaining high-quality standards.

### Code Architecture

The way I've organized the code follows `SOLID` and `Hexagonal Architecture principles while isolating the domain layer following `ddd-design`, making it easy to understand and maintain.

The business logic â€” the rules and processes we all understand â€” is encapsulated within the `Domain` directory. This is the common language that resonates with developers, stakeholders, program managers, and everyone involved in the project. It serves as a foundational agreement that unites us in our shared understanding. This also helped in testing and verifying the entire domain logic before thinking about any infrastructure details.

##### Key Components in the Domain

-   Entities:

The heart of the domain is the entities. These hold essential data, representing real-world concepts like orders, ingredients, and the specifics of the food we love. These entities act as the backbone of the system, defining what data we work with and how it relates.

-   Use Cases:

Within the `use cases`, we zoom in on specific scenarios, like creating an order. Here, use cases focus on the detailed steps and logic involved in executing a particular use case. This approach keeps our business logic organized and easy to follow.

-   Isolation and Dependency Management

The domain is deliberately isolated, meaning it operates independently of any infrastructure-related logic. This isolation is intentionalâ€” it allows us to maintain a clear distinction between what our system does (business logic) and how it does it (infrastructure logic).
https://github.com/iifawzi/foodi/blob/0aa62ae42c20c732d817cde111b30b846647c1e0/src/Application/services/OrderService.php#L15-L26

-   Dependency Injection:

as the code above shows, to facilitate this separation, we adopt a dependency injection approach. Instead of the application layer reaching out to infrastructure components, dependencies are injected into it, thanks to the defined interfaces.

This ensures flexibility and simplifies testing, as we can substitute real implementations with mocks, as we did in the integration tests.
where the entire business logic is tested using `in-memory` database. More on that, in the `Testing and Quality` section below.

https://github.com/iifawzi/foodi/blob/0aa62ae42c20c732d817cde111b30b846647c1e0/tests/Integration/Application/OrderServiceTest.php#L40-L54

The actual implementation of the repositories is on the infrastructure layer, where we can decide what to use, whether are we using `Eloquent` or any other solution, it doesn't matter. as long as they implement the repositories interfaces.

##### Application layer:

It mediates communication between core business logic (domain) and external systems (infrastructure), when ere I'm defining the `driven` ports, for external components to interact with the application layer.

The application layer is the layer that's responsible for the communication between the domain and the infrastructure, it defines the `driven` and `driving` ports.
for simplification in this project, I didn't implement any `driving` ports, the application service communicates directly with the domain's service. `driven` ports are defined in the repositories directory and the mail service. these ports must be implemented by anyone willing to interact/to be managed with/by the domain.

The application services are also infrastructure agnostic, hence you will notice that no `HTTP` errors are thrown for example, but instead, domain responses are returned.

https://github.com/iifawzi/foodi/blob/878ce9645f1655b725797233e122e71c468d004a/src/Application/services/OrderService.php#L57-L76

This gives us the flexibility of choosing any adapter in the infra, whether it's RPC, REST, or even socket layer. it doesn't matter.

##### Infrastructure layer:

The infrastructure layer serves as the foundation for a software system, housing implementations of the adapters both, the `repositories` and the `mailing service`. In this layer, you'll find the `eloquent` repositories implementations. on the other side, the `driven` adapters are defined in the core directory `app`. The infrastructure layer handles the technical and operational aspects that support the application's functionality.

### System Architecture

![Untitled Diagram drawio (2)](https://github.com/iifawzi/foodi/assets/46695441/a6f7d9b2-3a02-48aa-86e9-e45ec4f50dc8)

Anticipating and mitigating Murphy's Law `if anything can go wrong, it will`, the system architecture takes into account potential challenges:

-   Concurrency Challenge: when multiple orders are happening at once, there's a chance they could all think there are enough ingredients, leading to issues like overselling or running out of stock.

-   Mailing Service Reliability: Proactive measures are in place to address potential issues with sending emails. This includes scenarios where the mailing service is non-operational or the mailing queue experiences downtime.

For the concurrency challenge it really depends on a lot of factors, are we expecting immediate response to the user? or can we `queue` it and respond later with either confirmation or cancellation? or do we need to respond synchronously? I chose to respond synchronously.

to handle this, I used transactions with exclusive locks. All operations involved in processing the order, from checking the ingredient stocks to confirmation, are encapsulated within a transaction. This ensures that either all steps succeed, maintaining data consistency, or the entire transaction fails, preventing inconsistent order confirmations. in addition to that an exclusive lock is acquired when checking ingredient stocks. This lock ensures that only one order can access and modify the stock data at a time, preventing multiple orders from concurrently depleting the stock. The exclusive lock remains in place until the transaction is committed, safeguarding against race conditions during the critical confirmation phase.

https://github.com/iifawzi/foodi/blob/bf18902bd3a1d7f1a07700d68ceaf0feda75d472/src/Infrastructure/repositories/Eloquent/EloquentStockRepository.php#L16

on the other side, it's critical to notify the merchant about low stock. However, blocking order processing due to notification failures is not an option. 

Initially, the dispatcher was kept outside of the transaction to avoid hindering order flow. But, what if the system went down after order confirmation or if the notification queue was unavailable? This raised concerns about potential data loss.

- Transactional Outbox:
To ensure data integrity, the idea of a `outbox` table was introduced. Unlike keeping the dispatcher separate, now, the notification process is part of the actual transactions. When an order is confirmed, the system logs the notification details in an `low_stock_notification` table. If everything runs smoothly, this log is committed with the transaction. Later, when the worker performs the send mail action, it marks it as `SENT`. otherwise, it's still pending. 

- Scheduler for Resilience:
To handle scenarios where the queue might be down or the system faces disruptions after order confirmation, a scheduler was implemented. This scheduler regularly checks the `low_stock_notification`, specifically the outbox table, every 30 minutes. If it discovers any stuck notifications (those not marked as SENT), it dispatches them to the queue for processing.
