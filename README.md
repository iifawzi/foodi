# Foodi Orders!

# Requirements ðŸ“º

A Burger (Product) may have several ingredients:
- 150g Beef
- 30g Cheese
- 20g Onion

The system keeps the stock of each of these ingredients stored in the database. You
can use the following levels for seeding the database:
- 20kg Beef
- 5kg Cheese
- 1kg Onion

When a customer makes an order that includes a Burger. The system needs to update the
stock of each of the ingredients so it reflects the amounts consumed.
Also when any of the ingredients stock level reaches 50%, the system should send an
email message to alert the merchant they need to buy more of this ingredient.


In the sections below, I will explain the requirements have been approached, the architecture, decisions and thoughts. 


# Tl;dr - Summary

The system is designed to be reliable, adept at handling multiple orders concurrently, and easy to test while maintaining a high-quality standard.

## Code Architecture

The code architecture strictly adheres to good design principles, ensuring modularity and maintainability. Rigorous testing of the core components fortifies the system's reliability.

## System Architecture
Anticipating and mitigating Murphy's Law `if anything can go wrong, it will`, the system architecture takes into account potential challenges:

- Concurrency Challenge: The system adeptly manages multiple orders simultaneously, ensuring data consistency even during peak times.

- Mailing Service Reliability: Proactive measures are in place to address potential issues with sending emails. This includes scenarios where the mailing service is non-operational or the mailing queue experiences downtime.

By proactively addressing these challenges, the architecture aspires to furnish a Foodi Orders System characterized by reliability, resilience, and a seamless operational experience.
